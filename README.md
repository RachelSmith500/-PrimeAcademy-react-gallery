# React Photo Gallery

## Description

I built this app to display images. The user can add likes, toggle between viewing an image and viewing the description for the image. The app also tracks the number of times that an image has been liked. 

## Installation
Running the server code requires `nodemon`. If you don't already have `nodemon`, install it globally with `npm install nodemon --global`.

```
npm install
npm run server
```

Now that the server is running, open a new terminal tab with `cmd + t` and start the react client app.

```
npm run client
```

Between the server and client, you'll need two terminal tabs. Because we're using `nodemon`, both our client side and server side will automatically spin back up when changes are made.
## Built With

The technologies used to build this app are as follows: React, Axios, CSS, Node, JSON.

## Acknowledgement

Thanks to Prime Digital Academy who equipped and helped me to make this application a reality. Thank you also to Norbu Samphel and Adam Boerhave who helped me get past a couple of stumbling blocks while building this app.
